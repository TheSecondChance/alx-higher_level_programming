jQuery is a fast, lightweight, and feature-rich JavaScript library   
that simplifies the process of client-side web development.   
It provides a set of easy-to-use methods and functions for tasks such as DOM manipulation,   
event handling, AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) requests, and animation.   
jQuery aims to make it easier for developers 
to write concise and efficient code while working with JavaScript in web applications.
